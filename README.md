# About this project
It meant to be a control panel for my discord bot, but since the bot itself lacks functionality, this project will be stale (also i think that the code quality stinks)   
In this project I used React, Redux (probably gone overboard with that, but I don't like React's Context), react-pro-sidebar, and something else I can't even remember   
Feel free to use everything you can find here if you find it useful.
